            I don't care about the scars you hide Or the secrets that you've tried to fight 
            Every flaw, everything you've done I still see the fire, I see the sun 
            I don't care who held you before Or the hearts you left out on the floor 
            All I know is when you're with me You're wild, you're free, you're everything I need 
            Screw the doubt, screw the lies I see the truth behind your eyes 
            I don't care who had you before You look better with me, that's for sure.
        </p>
